<p style="font-family: Courier">
	"Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper. <br>
	I like this painting because of the scene's atmosphere and the contrasted lighting. <br>
	The figures seem to be socializing, all but a man who's back is to the viewer. <br>
	The woman is named and modeled after Hopper's wife, Josephine. <br>
    It also makes for a cool background if you don't use desktop shortcuts.

	alt="Triple_Self_Portrait" width=400px height=400px>

<p style="font-family: Courier"> 
	"Triple-Self Portrait" by Norman Rockwell. <br>
	I like this painting because of the simplicity yet depth of the scene. <br>
	Rockwell is doing a simple self-portrait using a mirror, he's surrounded by the clutter of his workspace. <br>
	Most objects around him are references to other works of art. <br>
	The painting is an impressive display of skill in itself. <br>
	A painting of a man painting himself...<br>
	That's like painting squared.

	alt="Garden of Earthly Delights" width=600px height=400px>
	
<p style="font-family: Courier">
	"Garden of Earthly Delights" by Hieronymus Bosch. <br>
	I like this painting because of the wide, spanning landscape yet the abundance of small details found within. <br>
	Religious symbolism is heavily present throught the entirety of the work.<br>
	It's divided into 3 sections from left to right, dubbed "Garden of Eden, Heaven, Hell". <br>
	The more weirder and intersting parts are found in the "Hell" section.
